# ⚡ FlashCraft - Quick Crafting for 1.18.2

**Tired of clicking recipes over and over?** FlashCraft brings the modern Quick Crafting feature from Minecraft 1.21.2 to version 1.18.2, making repetitive crafting a breeze!

## What Does It Do?

FlashCraft enhances the **Recipe Book** by adding keyboard shortcuts for instant crafting:

- **Press `Space` or `Enter`** → Craft one batch of the selected recipe
- **Hold `Shift` + `Space/Enter`** → Craft as many as possible with your materials
- **Includes audio feedback** → Satisfying click sound confirms each craft

No more endless clicking! Perfect for players who craft frequently and want a smoother, more efficient experience.

## 💡 Why FlashCraft?

If you're a builder, a redstoner, or just someone who crafts a lot, you know the pain of clicking the same recipe 50 times in a row. FlashCraft eliminates that tedium while maintaining the vanilla feel you love.

This mod is inspired by the official Quick Crafting feature added in Minecraft 1.21.2's Snapshot 24w34a, but backported and optimized for 1.18.2 players who want the same convenience.
